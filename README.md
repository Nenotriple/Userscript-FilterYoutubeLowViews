# Userscript-FilterYoutubeLowViews
Filters out videos/shorts with less than 1000 views from the recommendations and subscriptions feed on YouTube.

I understand that new uploaders should get some attention, but it just clogs the recommendations with things I will never watch.

The original script can be found here: [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/16oxn7m/is_there_a_way_to_stop_recommending_low_view/)

I made some adjustments, primarily so videos are hidden without needing to click/scroll the page.

The original script *(v3.3)* is provided for preservation.

Use with your prefered Userscript manager.
